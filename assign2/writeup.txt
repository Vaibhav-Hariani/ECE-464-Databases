Effectively, just have the scraper. Using redis as a NOSQL db, 
scraping the books.toscrape website as it's structured and simple enough
Broke my code up into segments for both readability and programmability.

I'm using the sentence-transformers library to generate embeddings as we 
used it for Deep Learning and it's a pretty convenient model

I scrape the site by iterating over the categories,
then the tiles within each page, 
and then the pages for each category.

This makes life pretty easy. 

I'm storing my data in Redis, I use a dict so that I can access each element individually
Makes things pretty clean, and I have vectors as another component as dictated by the redis guide
My keys are the UPC for each book, as I thought that makes sense, even if I'm not necessarily using them
