A few things the Business is missing: 

No way to verify a reservation is valid (A boat is available 
and a sailor is not scheduled at the same time)

By extension, there is no way for a boat to be 
available/in repairs/retired. This can cause issues.

No way to invoice/track total boat usage for billing by sailor/client.
In addition, no way to track boat hours for maintenence & support.


A simple extension to solve all of these would be a "status"
tag in the boat table, and "duration" field in the reservations.

This duration field could then be summed for each sailor weekly, creating a cost.

If different boats have different capabilities and therefore different rates,
A rate field for each boat would make aggregating for invoices very very easy.
